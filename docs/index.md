🚀 **AI helps you code, but engineering makes it:**

- **Maintainable** ✅ (Easy to update and fix later)
- **Scalable** 🚀 (Works as your project grows)
- **Secure** 🔒 (Protects your data and users)

## [1️⃣ AI is a Tool, Not a Crutch](./1/intro)
🔹 AI **guesses**, you **validate**. AI can help write code, but **you** make sure it works.  
🔹 Debugging is about **understanding** what went wrong, not just asking AI to try again.  
🔹 Treat AI-generated code like work from a teammate: **Review** it.  

## 2️⃣ Document Everything 📝  
🔹 Write down **why** you make decisions, not just **how** you did it.   
🔹 Define expectations **before coding**—this saves time and effort later.  
🔹 Good documentation helps everyone understand your work, preventing **surprises**.  

## 3️⃣ Seamless Dev Setup ⚡  
🔹 **Automate** setup (scripts, Docker, Makefiles) so anyone can get started quickly.  
🔹 Create an **FAQ** to save hours of answering the same questions.  
🔹 Keep environments consistent so things work on **any** machine.  

## 4️⃣ Writing Code That Lasts ⚙️  
🔹 Keep it **clean** and **simple**—less code is often better.  
🔹 Plan for **future changes**—easy-to-update code saves time later.  
🔹 Handle **errors** properly—don’t let mistakes break the system.  
🔹 Minimize dependencies to make your code more flexible.  
🔹 Focus on explaining **why** you wrote something, not just what it does.  

## 5️⃣ Versioning & Shipping 🚀 
🔹 **Commit often**—small changes are easier to fix if something goes wrong.
🔹 Use simple branching models like **Trunk-Based** OR **GitFlow**.
🔹 Small, tested changes make deployments safer.

## 6️⃣ Test Now or Suffer Later 🧪
🔹 AI-generated code is **untested**—you must test it.  
🔹 Write **Unit, Integration, and E2E** tests.  
🔹 Refactoring is painless when tests exist. 

## 7️⃣ Merge = Deploy 🔄  
🔹 CI/CD eliminates release fear.  
🔹 Automate testing & deployment.  
🔹 Ship small, ship often.  

## 8️⃣ Catch Bugs Early 🛠️  
🔹 Use **static analysis** & linters.  
🔹 Format & **automate everything**.  
🔹 Code reviews prevent **technical debt**.  

## 9️⃣ Monitor & Log Everything 📊
🔹 Logs without monitoring are useless.  
🔹 **Never log sensitive data**.  
🔹 Use tools like Prometheus, Sentry, and OpenTelemetry.

💡 **TL;DR:** AI can write code, but you make it **robust, scalable, and secure**. Stick to solid engineering practices, and your AI-assisted code won't turn into chaos. 🚀
